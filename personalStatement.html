				I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science in 2021. My intended career is to be a mobile game developer. I am fluent in both Mandarin Chinese and English. I am interested in mobile game applications with user interface(UI) and user experience(UX) designs. I believe I am a strong candidate for this program because I have a passion for creative art design and I have developed the skills of drawing and photography for nearly 10 years. In addition, I have three years of work experience in web/app development in a startup company with my friends. I am certain that the combination of my creative art design and developing software skills will help me to be a successful mobile game developer. 
I have enjoyed playing computer games with exquisite illustrations and stories since I was a child. Pokemon was the first game that inspired me to learn drawing. I thought my personality was more introverted, and I enjoyed staying in my imaginary world. Afterward, I joined the photography club when I was in middle school, and I analyzed various styles of photography in social media to make my photos more impressive. I believe that people are inherently attracted to things that are aesthetically pleasing to them, and this visual gratification is strong because our brains are evolutionarily designed to use vision more than other senses. I believe that there is a positive correlation between photography and drawing. The more photos I see, the more inspiration for the drawing will appear in my mind. Therefore, it will help me to design an amazing user interface in mobile game development.

When I was 15 years old, my family moved from Taiwan to the U.S. As a high school student, smartphones with built-in cameras were just released. I was fascinated by mobile games as well. I was aware that the use of smartphones would undoubtedly become mainstream in the future. The use of mobile apps can facilitate our daily lives, such as GPS or online shopping. Also, useful apps can not only save time but also reduce the fuel cost for us. As a result, I decided to pursue a major related to computers in college. The most inspiring course I took in college is about software engineering. This software engineering course taught us a systematic approach to design a software project from scratch in teamwork. The project of my team was to design a chat application, and my specific job was about user interface and user experience. The professor taught us that impressive user experience design is the key to attract people, especially in the competitive marketplace. Thus, I drew 5 different styles of homepages and chat rooms on scratch papers, and we took surveys in that class to ask which style is most comfortable in their minds. I felt satisfied when most people gave me positive feedback on my designed templates. Getting a high ranking in this class, I realized that my talent in creative art design was finally getting accepted. 
           In the summer of 2019, my friends and I built a startup company, which focuses on web/app development with spring boot. We have successfully built several websites and apps for restaurants and weddings. In general, we receive cases of building websites for restaurants. The homepage of a website is the critical factor to attract customers. The employee usually asked us to put their required photos, such as the interior and exterior design of the restaurant, meals, and promotions on the website. We had to discuss the template of the homepage about where the navigation bar and the photos should be. Additionally, we also need to consider the situation when the website may not be supported by some specific smartphones or browsers. I believe that being a photographer and developer are the double advantages of making websites successfully. In my mind, a successful website can make the viewers feel comfortable visually, and that website can present its designer’s exquisite masterpieces.

		   I would like to contribute my efforts to the dear company in user interface and user experience design in mobile game development. I believe that I have demonstrated my design skills as a photographer and illustrator. In my portfolio, there are many categories in artworks. Also, my school and side projects perfectly applied the REST API and bootstrap for CSS to optimize the time and space efficiency. There are also some designed templates on the website of our startup company as well. As a result, I can apply my knowledge in both creative art design and developing software skills to be a brilliant mobile game developer.
